1) what is a thread?
=====================
* A thread in Java simply represents a single independent path of execution of a group of statements.

2) What is multithreading?
===========================
* The process of executing multiple threads simultaneously (concurrently) is called multithreading in Java.

3) Diff btw process and thread?
===============================
Process
-------
* Each process can have more than one thread
* Every individual process has its own separate memory address space and can execute a different program.
* It takes more time for context switching.

Thread
-------
* creating a thread takes fewer resources
* It takes less time for context switching.
* All thread have same memory allocation


4) What is mean by throw and throws?
=====================================
* Throw and Throws is a keyword used to declare the custom exception in java.
* Throw is a keyword, we can through any exception inside the method.
* Throws is a keyword, it is used to declare the exception(in method level).

5) Runnable thread?
====================
java.lang.Runnable is an interface that is to be implemented by a class whose instances are intended to be executed by a thread.

6)what is Synchronization and its use?
=======================================
* Synchronization is used for thread safe
* It allows only one thread at a time

7) Default thread in program / java?
======================================
* Every Java program has always at least one thread, even if you do not create any thread. This thread is called main thread
* The main thread is also called parent thread and the rest of threads that are generated from it are called child threads of the program.

8) what is Process in java?
============================
* A process is a program that executes as a single thread.

9) What is know as context switch?
===================================
* The switching between two threads is known as context switch.

10) What is thread class?
==========================
* The switching between two threads is known as context switch.
* It is a predefined class declared in java.lang default package.

11) How to create threads?
===========================
* There are two ways to create a new thread in Java:

* One is by extending java.lang.Thread class:
      Syntax: Class Myclass extends Thread

* Another is by implementing java.lang.Runnable interface:
	-> Create a class that implements the 	runnable interface. 
 	-> Class to implement only the run method 	that constitutes the new thread.

12) Diff btw extending Thread and Implementing Runnable?
===============================================
Extending Thread
-----------------
Creating Worked thread.
Cannot extend any other class.
Thread's life cycle methods like interrupt() can be overridden.

Implementing Runnable
----------------------
Defining task.
Can extend any other class
Only run() method can be overridden.


13) Thread Life cycle
=======================
New (Newborn State)
Runnable state
Running state
Blocked state
Dead State

14) Thread Methods
===================
* start(): Initiates the execution of the thread.
* sleep(): Causes the thread to sleep for a specified amount of time.
* join(): Waits for the thread to die.
* wait(): Causes the current thread to wait until another thread invokes the notify() method.
* notify(): Wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the object.
* notifyAll(): Wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object.


15) what is the Default Exception occurs while using join() and sleep() methods?
=====================================================
* InterruptedException : It is thrown when the waiting or sleeping state is disrupted by another thread. 
* IllegalStateException : It is thrown when a thread is tried to start that is already started


16) what are 3 scheduling threads available?
=============================================
 MIN_PRIORITY =1
 NORM_PRIORITY=5
 MAX_PRIORITY= 10 


17) What is setPriority() & getPriority()?
===========================================
getPriority()
----------------
Thread class provides a method named getPriority() that is used to determine the priority of a thread. 
It returns the priority of a thread through which it is called.

setPriority()
---------------
The setPriority() of Thread class is used to set the priority of a thread. 
This method accepts an integer value as an argument and sets that value as priority of a thread through which it is called.


18) Types of Synchronization?
=============================
* Process Synchronization
* Thread Synchronization


19) What is the difference between runnable, running thread and block thread in Java?
========================================================================
* A RUNNABLE thread is one that is ready to run but may or may not be actually running, depending on the availability of CPU resources.
* A RUNNING thread is one that is currently executing its code. 
* A BLOCKED thread is one that is waiting to acquire a lock or a monitor to enter a synchronized block or method.
